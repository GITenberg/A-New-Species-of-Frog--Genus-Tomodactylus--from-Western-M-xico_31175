<h2>A New Species of Frog (Genus Tomodactylus)<br />
from Western M&eacute;xico.</h2>

<h4>BY<br /><br />
ROBERT G. WEBB</h4>


<p>Thirteen specimens of frogs collected in the summers of 1960
and 1961 in the Mexican states of Durango and Sinaloa represent
a heretofore unnamed species. The specimens have been deposited
in the Museum of Natural History of the University of Kansas
(KU) and in the Museum of Michigan State University (MSU).
The species may be named and described as follows:</p>

<p style='text-align:center;'><b>Tomodactylus saxatilis</b> new species</p>

<div class="pblockquot"><p><i>Holotype.</i>&mdash;KU 63326 (Fig. 1); obtained eight miles west of El Palmito,
Sinaloa, approximately 6100 feet, on 23 June 1961; original field number,
2354 of Robert G. Webb.</p>

<p><i>Paratypes.</i>&mdash;A total of 12 specimens: KU 63327-33, same data as holotype,
23-25 June 1961; MSU 4085-88, two miles north of Pueblo Nuevo, Durango,
approximately 6000 feet elevation, 24 July 1960; MSU 4089, one half mile
west of Revolcaderos, Durango, approximately 6600 feet, 29 July 1961.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;A species of <i>Tomodactylus</i> possessing the following combination
of characters: (1) tips of two outer fingers truncate, about twice width
of narrowest part of digit; (2) tympanum small, less than one half diameter
of eye; (3) ventral surfaces smooth; (4) contrasting marbled pattern on back
and top of head, and (5) venter whitish, lacking dark marks.</p>

<p><i>Description of holotype.</i>&mdash;Adult male; snout-vent length, 31.5 (measurements
are in millimeters and were taken by means of dial calipers reading to
one tenth of a millimeter); width of head, 11.2; length of head, 10.3; horizontal
diameter of eye, 3.1, and of tympanum, 1.2; distance from eye to nostril, 3.8;
internarial width, 2.9; interorbital width, 4.1; width of eyelid, 2.5; lumbar
gland (left side), 7.0 x 2.6; distance from axilla to groin, 15.2; tibial length,
12.7; length of foot, 13.1.</p>

<p>Head slightly wider than body; tip of snout rounded, slightly truncate;
canthus rounded; tympanum small, less than one half diameter of eye; tympanum
having posterior margin ill-defined, separated from eye by distance
about equal to diameter of tympanum; diameter of eye slightly less than distance
from eye to nostril; width of eyelid about two thirds interorbital width;
paratoid gland indistinct; lumbar glands high, separated from insertion of leg
by about one millimeter; back and sides of body having low, scarcely elevated
pustules; top of head, limbs and venter smooth; few low, whitish pustules
below and behind tympanum, and low on sides of body; posterior surface of
thighs and anal region pustulate; one pair of whitish postanal spots; ventral
disc attached near insertion of legs, lacking conspicuous transverse fold; skin
loose on throat, chest and abdomen.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Digits not webbed; tips of two outer fingers truncate, having terminal
transverse grooves, about twice width of narrowest part of digit; digits of
first and second fingers slightly expanded; fingers from shortest to longest,
1-2-4-3, first only slightly shorter than second; three palmar tubercles; inner
palmar tubercle about one third size of large median tubercle; outer tubercle
about one tenth size of large median tubercle; four supernumerary palmar
tubercles; tips of toes slightly wider than narrowest part of digits; toes from
shortest to longest, 1-2-5-3-4, second only slightly shorter than fifth; inner
metatarsal tubercle about four times size of small outer metatarsal tubercle;
supernumerary tubercles on foot small; no tarsal fold; heels touching when
tibiae adpressed to thighs; tibiotarsal articulation reaching eye when leg
adpressed to side of body.</p>

<p>Contrasting marbled pattern on back and top of head; contrasting, mostly
barred, pattern on limbs; ventral surfaces whitish, lacking dark marks, but
having minute dark peppering; marbling of dorsal surfaces blackish and
whitish in preservative.</p>

<p>Vomerine teeth lacking; internal choanae lateral, partly concealed by
maxillaries; tongue smooth, elongate, shallowly notched distally, free for about
half its length; vocal sac median; internal vocal slits large and near angle of jaw.</p>

<p><i>Variation.</i>&mdash;Twelve males closely resemble the holotype. Two specimens
from Pueblo Nuevo are soft and not well preserved. The ranges of variation
(means in parentheses) for the 13 males comprising the type series are: snout-vent
length, 25.5-31.5 (27.9); width of head, 9.7-11.2 (10.5); diameter of
eye, 2.9-3.6 (3.2); horizontal diameter of tympanum, 1.1-1.8 (1.4); length
of tibia, 11.1-13.1 (12.1); length of foot, 11.0-13.1 (12.1).</p>

<p>The pale ground color of the marbled pattern in most specimens is least
extensive on the back and arms, but most extensive on the legs. The lumbar
glands are slightly elevated and conspicuous, and in KU 63328 are extremely
protuberant, or (KU 63330) evident on left side but flattened and indistinct
on right side. The back is rough having low, scarcely elevated pustules, but
becomes less rough anteriorly and most of the top of head is smooth. The
three specimens from Pueblo Nuevo, Durango, differ slightly from the other
specimens examined in lacking pairs of postanal white spots, and in having
smooth backs (slightly pustulate in MSU 4088). The tibiotarsal articulation
fails to reach the eye in KU 63330. The small inner palmar tubercle is
continuous with the large median tubercle on the right hand of KU 63330, and
lacking on both hands of KU 63329 and on the left hand of KU 63328. The
tip of the tongue is entire in some specimens and in others has an irregular
margin.</p>

<p><i>Coloration of living specimens.</i>&mdash;Marbled pattern on back and top of head
of dark brown to blackish on yellowish-gold; pattern slightly less contrasting
on limbs than on back, consisting of brown to grayish on pale yellow; side
of head and body grayish sometimes having pale yellow to whitish spots;
iris blackish having fine reticulation of yellowish to greenish-gold; venter dirty
white.</p></div>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&mdash;The three records of occurrence for <i>Tomodactylus
saxatilis</i> are in a mixed boreal-tropical habitat, which is transitional
between a pine-oak forest at higher elevations and a tropical deciduous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
forest at lower elevations. The mixed boreal-tropical habitat
is most conspicuous at elevations between approximately 7800 and
5500 feet on southerly exposed slopes of barrancas and arroyos of
the dissected plateau of the Sierra Madre Occidental. The mixed
boreal-tropical habitat occurs for approximately 30 miles along the
paved highway (Mexican Highway 40) between Cd. Durango,
Durango, and Mazatl&aacute;n, Sinaloa. The records of occurrence in
those states that are along this highway are separated by 14.5 miles
(<i>via</i> road).</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span> <i>Tomodactylus saxatilis</i> new species, adult male, KU 63326,
holotype (&times; 2), dorsal view.</span>
</div>

<p>The terrain consists of occasional level areas, but is mostly of
steep hillsides. Dominant trees are large oaks and pines; a characteristic
pine is the sad or drooping-needle pine, locally called
"pino triste." The vegetational cover is usually open, including
grasses, small oaks and pines, broad-leaved shrubs and herbs,
prickly pears, magueys, thorny acacias, bracken fern, and epiphytes
in trees. Ferns occur in moist protected places, and orchids are
occasional, sometimes in trees.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Outcrops of rock, boulder-strewn areas, and occasional rock
slides (talus) also characterize the terrain. <i>Tomodactylus saxatilis
</i>seems to be restricted to rocky habitats. The individuals collected
were detected when they called at night from within crevices of
rocks or from exposed perches on rocks and boulders; some calling
frogs were out of reach on steep rock walls. The call is a single,
loud, high peep.</p>

<div class="pblockquot"><p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;Dixon (1957) recognized six species of <i>Tomodactylus</i>
(<i>nitidus</i>, <i>dilatus</i>, <i>albolabris</i>, <i>angustidigitorum</i>, <i>fuscus</i> and <i>grandis</i>) in his
revision of the genus. Another species (<i>rufescens</i>) was subsequently described
by Duellman and Dixon (1959). <i>Tomodactylus saxatilis</i> differs from all the
species named immediately above by the combination of characters given in
the diagnosis. <i>Tomodactylus saxatilis</i> differs from <i>nitidus</i>, <i>angustidigitorum</i>
and <i>grandis</i> in having the tips of the two outer fingers widened and truncate;
<i>saxatilis</i> differs from <i>dilatus</i>, <i>albolabris</i>, <i>fuscus</i> and <i>rufescens</i> in having a smooth
venter (not pustulate), a contrasting pale and dark marbled pattern on the
back, and a lack of "flash" colors on the femora.</p>

<p><i>Tomodactylus saxatilis</i>, having lumbar glands, also resembles three species
referred to the genus <i>Syrrhophus</i>. <i>Tomodactylus macrotympanum</i> was described
by Taylor (1940:496, 497) as having a large, moderately distinct
lumbar gland; the species was referred to the genus <i>Syrrhophus</i> by Dixon
(<i>op. cit.</i>:384). According to Firschein (1954:55), <i>Syrrhophus smithi</i> and
<i>S. petrophilus</i> have elongate lumbar glands shaped like those in <i>Tomodactylus</i>.
<i>Tomodactylus saxatilis</i> resembles <i>macrotympanum</i>, <i>smithi</i> and <i>petrophilus</i>
more than it does other species; all four attain large maximal sizes, and have
lumbar glands, mostly smooth ventral surfaces, three palmar tubercles (sometimes
absent in <i>saxatilis</i>), and usually contrasting dorsal patterns (reduced to
flecks and spots in all species except <i>saxatilis</i>). <i>Tomodactylus saxatilis</i> differs
from <i>macrotympanum</i> in having an extensive marbled dorsal pattern and a
small tympanum, and differs from <i>smithi</i> and <i>petrophilus</i> in having a marbled
dorsal pattern and the tips of the outer two fingers widened and truncate.
<i>Tomodactylus saxatilis</i> differs from all other named species of <i>Syrrhophus</i> in
having conspicuous lumbar glands and in lacking inguinal glands.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The characteristics delimiting the genera <i>Tomodactylus</i>
and <i>Syrrhophus</i> are not agreed upon by all workers (see discussions
by Firschein, 1954:50; Langebartel and Shannon, 1956:164;
and Dixon, 1957:383). I have referred <i>saxatilis</i> to the genus <i>Tomodactylus</i>
on the basis of a lumbar gland, which was considered a
distinguishing character for the genus by Smith and Taylor
(1948:46) and Langebartel and Shannon (1956:165). Lumbar
glands are longer than broad, at least one third the distance from
axilla to groin, lateral and usually high, and often conspicuous and
protuberant. The elevation or flatness of the lumbar glands seems
to be due to individual variation; living specimens in the field had
conspicuous and protuberant, or non-elevated, indistinct lumbar
glands. Lumbar glands are not to be confused with inguinal glands,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
which are roundish, often yellowish, sometimes diffuse, lateral but
low, often inconspicuous, and usually not protuberant. Inguinal
glands occur in the genus <i>Microbatrachylus</i> and in some species of
<i>Eleutherodactylus</i>, and have been described as flat, or low, or small,
or indistinct for most species of <i>Syrrhophus</i>.</p>

<p>For financial assistance with field work I am grateful to Rollin
H. Baker, and those individuals who administer the Michigan State
University Development Fund and the Bache Fund of the National
Academy of Sciences (Grant No. 463). I am grateful also to
J. Keever Greer, Donald F. Switzenberg, and Rudolph A. Scheibner
for aid in the field, to Edward H. Taylor, James R. Dixon, and
William E. Duellman for profitable discussions, and to Thomas
Sweringen for figure 1. The specific name alludes to the habitat
(Latin, <i>saxatilis</i> = found among rocks).</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
